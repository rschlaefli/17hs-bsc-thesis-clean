@article{Auffhammer.2012,
 abstract = {Recent research indicates that monsoon rainfall became less frequent but more intense in India during the latter half of the Twentieth Century, thus increasing the risk of drought and flood damage to the country's wet-season (kharif) rice crop. Our statistical analysis of state-level Indian data confirms that drought and extreme rainfall negatively affected rice yield (harvest per hectare) in predominantly rainfed areas during 1966--2002, with drought having a much greater impact than extreme rainfall. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we find that yield would have been 1.7{\%} higher on average if monsoon characteristics, especially drought frequency, had not changed since 1960. Yield would have received an additional boost of nearly 4{\%} if two other meteorological changes (warmer nights and lower rainfall at the end of the growing season) had not occurred. In combination, these changes would have increased cumulative harvest during 1966--2002 by an amount equivalent to about a fifth of the increase caused by improvements in farming technology. Climate change has evidently already negatively affected India's hundreds of millions of rice producers and consumers.},

@article{Befort.2016,
 abstract = {This study aims to validate the widely used regional climate model COSMO-CLM driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis data with a spatial resolution of 55 km with respect to observed features of the intraseasonal variability of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) during the period 1979 until 2011. One of these features is the northward propagation of the ISM intraseasonal oscillations. We find, that the temporal evolution between model and observation is in good agreement, while less agreement with respect to the strength is found. Furthermore, the model's capability to simulate observed dry and wet events on a weekly time-scale is investigated using the standardized precipitation index. In general, the model is capable to simulate these events with a similar magnitude at the same time. Observational based analyses show, that the coupling between atmospheric circulation anomalies and rainfall anomalies over India on the intraseasonal time scale is well represented by the model. The most important circulation anomalies for dry events are a lower tropospheric anticyclonic vortex over India and partly an upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex over the Pakistan region and vice versa for wet events. The model shows a slightly higher ability to simulate dry compared to wet events. Overall, this study shows that the current configuration of COSMO-CLM is able to simulate the key features of the intraseasonal variability of the Indian summer monsoon. Being aware of its limitation, COSMO-CLM is suitable to investigate possible changes of the intraseasonal variability of ISM under changed climate conditions in the past or in the future.},

@inproceedings{Donahue.2015,
 abstract = {Models based on deep convolutional networks have dominated recent image interpretation tasks; we investigate whether models which are also recurrent, or ``temporally deep'', are effective for tasks involving sequences, visual and otherwise. We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value ofthese models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image description and retrieval problems, and video narration challenges. In contrast to current models which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are ``doubly deep'' in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal ``layers''. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined and/or optimized.},

@article{Gill.2017,
 abstract = {Using a multiproxy reduced dimension methodology, we reconstruct fields of Arabian Sea summer wind stress curl and Indian monsoon rainfall anomalies since early Holocene using sea surface temperature (SST) proxies (Mg/Ca and alkenones) from 27 locations scattered across the equatorial Pacific. Reconstructions of summer wind stress curl reveal positive anomalies of $\sim$30{\%} greater than present day off the coastlines of Oman and Yemen at 10 ka, suggesting enhanced ocean upwelling and an enhanced monsoon jet during this time. Positive wind stress curl anomalies in these regions continued but weakened to $\sim$12{\%} greater than present day at 6 ka. Wind stress curl anomalies increased by about 8{\%} from 6 to 4 ka but declined again until 2 ka. Positive anomalies in wind stress curl during the early to middle Holocene are consistent with greater early Holocene abundances of the upwelling indicator Globigerina bulloides in the western Arabian Sea, which accumulates most rapidly in present climates during periods of marked upwelling. Spatial rainfall reconstructions reveal the greatest difference in precipitation at 10 ka over the core monsoon region ($\sim$20--60{\%} greater than present day) and concurrently the greatest deficit in rainfall in North East India and on the eastern side of the Western Ghats ($\sim$10--30{\%} less than present day). Specifically, reconstructions for 10 ka reveal 40--60{\%} greater rainfall than present day over northwest India. These findings advance the hypothesis that teleconnections from the equatorial Pacific contributed to, if not accounted for, greater early to middle Holocene wetness over India as recorded by various (e.g., cave, lacustrine, and discharge) paleoclimate proxies throughout the monsoon region.},

@article{Greff.2017,
 abstract = {Several variants of the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ( $\approx$ 15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},

 abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.  The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

In this work, we aim to determine whether the LSTM architecture is optimal or whether much better architectures exist. We conducted a thorough architecture search where we evaluated over ten thousand different RNN architectures, and identified an architecture that outperforms both the LSTM and the recently-introduced Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) on some but not all tasks. We found that adding a bias of 1 to the LSTM's forget gate closes the gap between the LSTM and the GRU.},

Recent trends on various literatures show that Deep Learning (Neural Network) is a promising methodology to tackle many challenging tasks. In this study, we introduce a brand-new data-driven precipitation prediction model called DeepRain. This model predicts the amount of rainfall from weather radar data, which is three-dimensional and four-channel data, using convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM). ConvLSTM is a variant of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) containing a convolution operation inside the LSTM cell. For the experiment, we used radar reflectivity data for a two-year period whose input is in a time series format in units of 6 min divided into 15 records. The output is the predicted rainfall information for the input data. Experimental results show that two-stacked ConvLSTM reduced RMSE by 23.0{\%} compared to linear regression.},

Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network ({\textquotedbl}PredNet{\textquotedbl}) architecture that is inspired by the concept of {\textquotedbl}predictive coding{\textquotedbl} from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. Altogether, these results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.},

@article{May.2004,
 abstract = {In this study the potential impact of the anticipated increase in the greenhouse gas concentrations on different aspects of the Indian summer monsoon is investigated, focusing on the role of the mechanisms leading to these changes. Both changes in the mean aspects of the Indian summer monsoon and changes in its interannual variability are considered. This is done on the basis of a global time-slice experiment being performed with the ECHAM4 AGCM at a high horizontal resolution of T106. The experiment consists of two 30-year simulations, one representing the present-day climate (period: 1970--1999) and one representing the future climate (period: 2060--2089). The timeslice experiment predicts an intensification of the mean rainfall associated with the Indian summer monsoon due to the general warming, while the future changes in the large-scale flow indicate a weakening of the monsoon circulation in the upper troposphere and only little change in the lower troposphere. The intensification of the monsoon rainfall in the Indian region is related to an intensification of the atmospheric moisture transport into this region. The weakening of the monsoon flow is caused by a pronounced warming of the sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific and the associated alterations of the Walker circulation. A future increase of the temperature difference between the Indian Ocean and central India as well as a future reduction of the Eurasian snow cover in spring would, by themselves, lead to a strengthening of the monsoon flow in the future. These two mechanisms compensate for the weakening of the low-level monsoon flow induced by the warming of the tropical Pacific. The timeslice experiment also predicts a future increase of the interannual variability of both the rainfall associated with the Indian summer monsoon and of the large-scale flow. A major part of this increase is accounted for by enhanced interannual variability of the sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific.},

 abstract = {The Indian summer monsoon onset is one of the most expected meteorological events of the world, affecting the lives of hundreds ofmillions of people. The IndiaMeteorological Department has dated the monsoon onset since 1901, but its original methodology was considered subjective and it was updated in 2006. Unfortunately, the new method relies on OLR measurements, which impedes the construction of an objective onset series before the 1970s. An alternative approach is the use of the wind field, but the development of such an index is limited to the period covered by reanalysis products. In this paper historical wind records taken on board ships are used to develop a newonset series using only wind directionmeasurements, providing an objective record of the onset since the late nineteenth century. The new series captures the rapid precipitation increase associated with the onset, correlates well with previous approaches, and is robust against anomalous (bogus) onsets. A tendency for later-than-average onsets during the 1900--25 and 1970--90 periods and earlier-than-average onsets between 1940 and 1965 was found. A relatively stable relationship between ENSO and Indian monsoon onset dates was found; however, this link tends to be weaker during decades characterized by prevalent La Ni{\~n}a conditions. Furthermore, it was found that the link between the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the onset date is limited to the phases characterized by a shift from negative to positive PDO phases.},

 abstract = {The summer monsoon onset over Kerala (MOK) marks the beginning of the rainy season for the country. Associated with the MOK, significant transitions of large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns are observed over the Asia--Pacific region. In this study, a new method for the objective identification of MOK, based on large scale circulation features and rainfall over Kerala, is discussed. Further, a set of empirical models based on the principal component regression (PCR) technique was developed for the prediction of the date of MOK by keeping in mind the IMD's operational forecasting service requirements. Predictors for the models were derived using correlation analysis from the thermal, convective and circulation patterns. Only five predictors pertaining to the second half of April were used in the first model (Model-1) so that the prediction of MOK can be prepared by the end of April itself. The second model (Model-2) used four additional predictors pertaining up to the first half of May along with two predictors used in the Model-1 for update prediction at the end of the first half of May. To develop each of the PCR models, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the respective predictor data was carried out followed by regression analysis of first two principal components (PCs) with the date of MOK. Both these models showed good skill in predicting the date of MOK during the independent test period of 1997--2007. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the predictions from both the models during the independent test period was about four days which was nearly half the RMSE of the predictions based on climatology.},

 abstract = {Ahigh resolution regional climate modeling system, known as PRECIS (Providing REgional Climate for Impact Studies), developed by Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, UK, is applied for Indian subcontinent to assess the impact of climate change on the summer monsoon onset characteristics. The present day simulation (1961--1990) with PRECIS is evaluated for the characteristics of onset over Kerala, southernmost part of India, where the monsoon sets in over Indian landmass. The meteorological parameters like precipitation, outgoing long wave radiation (OLR), and low level winds are analysed to study the monsoon onset over Kerala. The model is able to capture the sudden and sharp increase of rainfall associated with the onset. The rapid built-up of convective activity over the southeastern Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal is well represented by the model. PRECIS simulations, under scenarios of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and sulphate aerosols, are analysed to study the likely changes in the onset characteristics in future, towards the end ofpresent century (2071--2100). The analysis does not indicate significant difference in the mean onset dates in A2 and B2 scenarios. However, the variability of onset date is likely to be more towards the end of the 21st century especially in A2 scenario.},

 abstract = {Monsoon onset is an inherent transient phenomenon of Indian Summer Monsoon and it was never envisaged that this transience can be predicted at long lead times. Though onset is precipitous, its variability exhibits strong teleconnections with large scale forcing such as ENSO and IOD and hence may be predictable. Despite of the tremendous skill achieved by the state-of-the-art models in predicting such large scale processes, the prediction of monsoon onset variability by the models is still limited to just 2-3 weeks in advance. Using an objective definition of onset in a global coupled ocean-atmosphere model, it is shown that the skillful prediction of onset variability is feasible under seasonal prediction framework. The better representations/simulations of not only the large scale processes but also the synoptic and intraseasonal features during the evolution of monsoon onset are the comprehensions behind skillful simulation of monsoon onset variability. The changes observed in convection, tropospheric circulation and moisture availability prior to and after the onset are evidenced in model simulations, which resulted in high hit rate of early/delay in monsoon onset in the high resolution model.},

Moreover, we can easily visualize the time evolution of the delay and synchronization level with an excellent resolution. We apply the algorithm to short rat electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, some of them containing spikes. We also apply it to an intracranial human EEG recording containing an epileptic seizure, and we propose that the method might be useful for the detection of epileptic foci.

More precisely, given a dynamic image, we predict the motion evolution through next unseen video frames. Since this representation consists of a sequence of frames, we can go one second further into the future compared to the previous work in this field. We employed convolutional LSTMs to train our network on the dynamic images in an unsupervised learning process. Since our final goal is predicting the next action of a complex task such as an assembly task, we exploited labelled actions for the recognition process on top of predicted dynamic images.

RCP8.5 simulations project shortening of the LRS of Indian summer monsoon by altering the timing of onset and withdrawal dates. Most CMIP5 RCP8.5 model simulations indicate a faster warming rate over the western tropical Indian Ocean compared to other regions of the Indian Ocean. It is found that the pronounced western Indian Ocean warming and associated increase in convection results in warmer upper troposphere over the Indian Ocean compared to the Indian subcontinent, reducing the meridional gradient in upper tropospheric temperature (UTT) over the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) domain. The weakening of the meridional gradient in UTT induces weakening of easterly vertical wind shear over the ASM domain during first and last phase of monsoon, facilitate delayed (advanced) monsoon onset (withdrawal) dates, ensues the shortening of LRS of the Indian summer monsoon in a warming scenario.},

@article{Singh.2009,
 abstract = {Following a unified approach, an objective criterion has been developed for the determination of yearwise onset and withdrawal dates of the summer monsoon over the 19 subregions across India. In total 14 meteorological parameters are considered in the development of the objective criteria, two of which represent heating over south Asia-Middle East sector and Tibet-Himalaya-Karakoram-Hindukush Highlands (THIKHIHILS), two intensity of the general atmospheric circulation (GAC) over eastern hemisphere, three intensity of regional circulations and seven local hydro-meteorological conditions. The period of study is 1951-2007. The results are excellent to very good for the peninsula where relationship of monsoon activities with circulation parameters can be visualized relatively easily, and satisfactory for the remaining parts. Rainfall activities at the time of onset over different subregions are different. They are categorized as abrupt, gradual and feeble. An arbitrary definition for the categories is as: if more than 40{\%} of the 30-day rainfall at the time of onset occurs in the last 5 days (including onset date), the onset is regarded as abrupt, between 40{\%} and 25{\%} as gradual and less than 35{\%} as feeble. For the whole country, the frequency of the abrupt, gradual and feeble onset is {\~{}}42{\%}, {\~{}}22{\%} and {\~{}}36{\%} respectively. The error is least in the determination of normal and moderately early-late onset dates ({\~{}}5 days) and large that of very early-late onset (7.1-7.8 days), and least error in abrupt onset (4.5 days) and large in gradual (6.3 days) and feeble (7.4 days). Rainfall activities at the time of withdrawal can be also categorized as abrupt, gradual and feeble. Similar to onset date an arbitrary definition for the categories is as: if more than 40{\%} of the 30-day rainfall at the time of withdrawal occurs in the first 5 days (including onset date), the withdrawal is regarded as abrupt, between 40{\%} and 25{\%} as gradual and less than 35{\%} as feeble. For the whole country, the frequency of abrupt, gradual and feeble withdrawal is {\~{}}30{\%}, {\~{}}15{\%} and {\~{}}55{\%} respectively. For determining the normal and moderately early-late withdrawal dates the error is least (5.6-7.1 days) and large for very early-late withdrawals (8.9-9.6 days). Further, the error is least for abrupt withdrawal (6.7 days) and large for gradual and feeble withdrawal dates (7.3-7.8 days). Information related to withdrawal date is not very reliable but is given here as an appraisal to the researchers interested to take up the problem in the future. In general, the objective determination is best when the occurrence of the onsetwithdrawal is abrupt and worst when feeble. Limitations of the objective approach for the determination of onset and withdrawal dates of the Indian summer monsoon are indicated.},

@article{Sinha.2015,
 abstract = {Observations show that summer rainfall over large parts of South Asia has declined over the past five to six decades. It remains unclear, however, whether this trend is due to natural variability or increased anthropogenic aerosol loading over South Asia. Here we use stable oxygen isotopes in speleothems from northern India to reconstruct variations in Indian monsoon rainfall over the last two millennia. We find that within the long-term context of our record, the current drying trend is not outside the envelope of monsoon's oscillatory variability, albeit at the lower edge of this variance. Furthermore, the magnitude of multi-decadal oscillatory variability in monsoon rainfall inferred from our proxy record is comparable to model estimates of anthropogenic-forced trends of mean monsoon rainfall in the 21st century under various emission scenarios. Our results suggest that anthropogenic-forced changes in monsoon rainfall will remain difficult to detect against a backdrop of large natural variability.},

@article{Su.2017,
 abstract = {We present an approach to jointly detect mitotic events spatially and temporally in time-lapse phase contrast microscopy images. In particular, we combine a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to detect mitotic events in patch sequences. The CNN-LSTM network can be trained end-to-end to simultaneously learn convolutional features within each frame and temporal dynamics between frames, without hand-crafted visual or temporal feature design. Owing to the LSTM layer, this approach is able to detect mitotic events in patch sequences of variable length, as well as making use of longer context information among frames in the sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to detect mitosis using deep learning in both spatial and temporal domains. Experiments have shown that the CNN-LSTM network can be trained efficiently, and we evaluate this design by applying the network to original raw microscopy image sequences to locate mitotic events both spatially and temporally. The data with which we validate the proposed method include C3H10 mesenchymal and C2C12 myoblastic stem cell populations. Our approach achieved the F score of 98.72{\%} on the C2C12 data set, and the F score of 96.5{\%} on the C3H10 data set. The results on both data sets outperform the traditional graph modelbased approaches by a large margin, both in terms of detection accuracy and frame localization accuracy. Furthermore, we have developed a framework to aid humans in annotating mitosis with high efficiency and accuracy in raw phase contrast microscopy images based on the joint detection results using the proposed method. Under this framework, expert level annotations can be obtained in raw phase contrast microscopy image sequences, and the annotations have shown to further improve the training performance of the CNN-LSTM network.},

We select likely predictors based on association rules that have the highest confidence levels. We then cluster the selected predictors to reduce their dimensions and use cluster membership values for classification. We derive the predictors from local conditions in southern India, including mean sea level pressure, wind speed, and maximum and minimum temperatures. The global condition variables include southern oscillation and Indian Ocean dipole conditions. The algorithm predicts rainfall in five categories: Flood, Excess, Normal, Deficit and Drought. We use closed itemset mining, cluster membership calculations and a multilayer perceptron function in the algorithm to predict monsoon rainfall in peninsular India. Using Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology data, we found the prediction accuracy of our proposed approach to be exceptionally good.},

@article{Wang.2002,
 abstract = {To date, the monsoon-research community has not yet reached a consensus on a unified definition of monsoon rainy season or on the linkage between the onsets over the Asian continent and the adjacent oceans. A single rainfall parameter is proposed, and a suite ofuniversal criteria for defining the domain, onset, peak, and withdrawal of the rainy season are developed. These results reveal a cohesive spatial--temporal structure of the Asian--Pacific monsoon rainy season characteristics, which will facilitate validation of monsoon hydrological cycles simulated by climate system models and improve our understanding of monsoon dynamics.

The large-scale onset of the Asian monsoon rainy season consists of two phases. The first phase begins with the rainfall surges over the South China Sea (SCS) in mid-May, which establishes a planetary-scale monsoon rainband extending from the south Asian marginal seas (the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the SCS) to the subtropical western North Pacific (WNP). The rainband then advances northwestward, initiating the continental Indian rainy season, the Chinese mei-yu, and the Japanese baiu in early to mid-June (the second phase). The heights of the rainy seasons occur primarily in three stepwise phases: in late June over the mei-yu/baiu regions, the northern Bay of Bengal, and the vicinity of the Philippines, in late July over India and northern China; and in mid-August over the tropical WNP. The rainy season retreats northward over east Asia, yet it moves southward over India and the WNP.

Clear distinctions in the characteristics of the rainy season exist among the Indian, east Asian, and WNP summer monsoon regions. Nevertheless, the rainy seasons of the three subsystems also show close linkage. The causes of the regional distinctions and linkages are discussed. Also discussed are the atypical monsoon rainy seasons, such as the skewed and bimodal seasonal distributions found in various places of Asian monsoon domain.},

@article{Wang.2009,
 abstract = {The onset of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) over the southern tip of the Indian peninsula [also known as monsoon onset over Kerala (MOK)] has been considered the beginning of India's rainy season. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) makes an official prediction of ISM onset every year using a subjective method. Based on an analysis of the past 60-yr (1948--2007) record, the authors show that the onset date can be objectively determined by the beginning of the sustained 850-hPa zonal wind averaged over the southern Arabian Sea (SAS) from 58 to 158N, and from 408 to 808E. The rapid establishment of a steady SAS westerly is in excellent agreement with the abrupt commencement of the rainy season over the southern tip of the Indian peninsula. In 90{\%} of the years analyzed, this simple and objective index has excellent agreement with the onset dates that are subjectively defined by the IMD. There are only 3 yr of the past 60 yr during which the two onset dates differ by more than 10 days, and none of them perfectly reflects the MOK.

A prominent onset precursor on the biweekly time scale is the westward extension of the convection center from the equatorial eastern Indian Ocean toward the southeast Arabian Sea. On the intraseasonal time scale, the onset tends to be led by northeastward propagation of an intraseasonal convective anomaly from the western equatorial Indian Ocean. The objective determination of the onset based on the SAS low-level westerly is a characteristic representation of the complex process of the ISM onset. Given its objectiveness and its representation of the large-scale circulation, the proposed new onset definition provides a useful metric for verifying numerical model performance in simulating and predicting the ISM onset and for studying predictability of interannual variations of the onset.},

@article{Zhang.2004,
 abstract = {Based on the 1979--95 mean pentad reanalysis data from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction, the climatological characteristics and physical mechanism of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) onset are investigated. Special focus is given to whether the ASM onset starts earlier over the Indochina Peninsula than over the South China Sea (SCS) and why the ASM is established the earliest over Southeast Asia.

An examination of the composite thermodynamic and dynamic quantities confirms that the ASM onset commences earliest over the Indochina Peninsula, as highlighted by active convection and rainfall resulting from the convergence of southwesterly flow from the Bay of Bengal (BOB) vortex and easterly winds associated with the subtropical anticyclone over the SCS. Two other important characteristics not previously noted are also identified: the earliest reversal of meridional temperature gradient throughout the entire troposphere and the corresponding establishment of an easterly vertical wind shear, which are due to upper level warming caused by eddy (convective) transport of latent heat.

These changes in the large-scale circulation suggest that, in addition to rainfall, a reversal in the planetary-scale circulation should be included in determining the timing of the ASM onset. With such a consideration, the climatological ASM onset occurs first over southeastern BOB and southwestern Indochina Peninsula in early May, and then advances northeastward to reach the SCS by the fourth pentad of May (16--20 May). The monsoon then covers the entire Southeast Asia region by the end of May. Subsequently, a similar onset process begins over the eastern Arabian Sea, India and western BOB, and the complete establishment of the ASM over India is accomplished in mid June. In the process of the onset of each ASM component, the reversal of the upper level planetary-scale circulation depends strongly on that of the meridional temperature gradient. Over the Indochina Peninsula, the seasonal transition of upper level temperature results from convection-induced diabatic heating, whereas over western Asia it is attributed to subsidence warming induced by the active ascending motion over the former region.

The steady increase in surface sensible heating over the Indian subcontinent and the latent heating over the tropical Indian Ocean in April to early May appear to be the major impetus for the development of the cyclonic vortex over the BOB. A similar enhancement over the Arabian Peninsula and the surrounding regions is also identified to be crucial to the development of the so-called onset vortex over the Arabian Sea, and then ultimately to the ASM onset over India.
