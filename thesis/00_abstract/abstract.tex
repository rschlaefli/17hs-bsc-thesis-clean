Each year, the Indian Summer Monsoon affects more than one billion people, making clear the importance of accurate statistical analysis of its behavior. In this work, we analyze the spatial distribution of extreme monsoon rainfall and propose a new way of predicting monsoon onset dates. We build networks of correlated locations on the Indian subcontinent, analyzing them with established centrality measures. These centrality measures reveal the relative importance of locations like the Indian Ocean, the Tibetan Plateau, and Northern Pakistan. We additionally adopt recent advances in machine learning and neural networks to predict monsoon onset dates based on spatiotemporal meteorological datasets. With experiments on these datasets, we show that our model is able to predict onset dates more accurately than existing methods several days in advance.
